<h1>Internationalization</h1>

<p>For users from other countries, <em>Grammar Editor</em>'s text can be
translated into other languages. Doing this requires a minimal
knowledge of creating JAR files using Java.</p>

<p>The <tt>grammar.jar</tt> archive contains the file
``<tt>grammar/lang/str_en_US.properties</tt>''.
This file consists of lines, with an identifier (which you should not
change) to the left of an equal sign and the corresponding text to the
right. To translate the program to another language, simply translate
the text to the right of each equal sign in this file.</p>

<p>After you have translated the text messages,
place your translated file into the same directory.
The file should be the same name, except that the ISO two-letter
codes should stand in for the language code (<tt>en</tt> for English)
and for the country code (<tt>US</tt> for the United States).
The next time you start the program,
it should automatically identify your new locale and place it into the
Locale submenu of the Options menu.</p>

<p>The documentation, stored as separate HTML files in the
<tt>grammar/doc</tt> directory, should also be translated.
The properties file (as described above) allows you to configure the
file names used by the help system so that it refers to your translated
files instead.</p>

<p>I welcome any translations of the properties file (and preferably
the HTML documentation too!), so that I can include it in future
versions for other users from your country. My e-mail address is
<tt>cburch@cburch.com</tt>. Thank you!</p>
